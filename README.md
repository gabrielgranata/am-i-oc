# Stock Clock

A Google Chrome extension centred around the stock market, with the current main feature being stock price alerts.
To set up your portfolio you'd like to track, download the google chrome extension and head to the options page. From the options page, users can then add as many tickers as they would like, and be able to set low & high tracking prices. When the price of the stock drops or raises to these set prices, a notification is sent to the user's chrome browser, where they can take whatever action they would like.
